```

## Acceptance Criteria

> Must contain class based counter and a function based counter.

> Must contain a banner on the top of the page with a title of "React Counter" and a sub-title of "Please use the buttons to interact with your counter".

> The counter value must be displayed as `Counter: 0` on initial load in the counter section.

## Conclusion

To conclude, this was a enjoyable project to show how class and functional components and useState hook works in React. I believe the project meets the brief that I set out to create and we have developed the coding skills and knowledge.

Thank you!
